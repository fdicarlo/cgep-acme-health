Patient Intake API for Acme Health, governed as a CGE-P compliance engineering capstone.

## What This Is

This repository starts from the deliberately flawed `cgep-app-starter` workload and layers on enforceable governance controls:

- Terraform baseline module for KMS, CloudTrail, and immutable evidence storage
- HIPAA-primary and SOC 2-secondary OPA/Rego policy gates
- GitHub Actions plan, policy, apply, evidence signing, and evidence upload workflow
- OSCAL component definition and HIPAA profile mapping implemented controls to the selected frameworks

The inherited workload is intentionally small: API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and VPC networking for a patient intake flow.

## Frameworks

Primary framework: HIPAA Security Rule

Secondary framework: SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria

CMMC is retained in the starter reference material for comparison, but this submission claims HIPAA as primary and SOC 2 as secondary.

## Local Commands

Set `AWS_PROFILE` in your shell or pass it to `make`.

```bash
make creds AWS_PROFILE=<your-sandbox-profile>
make deploy AWS_PROFILE=<your-sandbox-profile>
make test AWS_PROFILE=<your-sandbox-profile>
```

Run the policy checks against a fresh Terraform plan:

```bash
scripts/bootstrap-terraform-backend.sh
cd terraform
terraform init -input=false
terraform plan -out=tfplan -no-color
terraform show -json tfplan > plan.json
cd ..
opa test policies/
conftest test --policy policies --namespace compliance.hipaa.s3_kms terraform/plan.json
```

The GitHub Actions workflow runs the full HIPAA gate across all namespaces.

Verify the latest signed evidence object in S3:

```bash
scripts/verify-evidence.sh --vault <evidence-vault-bucket>
```
